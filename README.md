## Overview
Beat Virus is a rhythm based shooter game in virtual reality. In Beat Virus, multi colored germ-like enemies spawn to the beat of the music and float towards the player. In order to survive and score points, the player must fight back with two different colored projectile weapons and hit the the enemy with the matching color. On top of the that, one will build a combo multiplier if he or she shoots the enemies on beat.
